## How It Works

3. Parses domains and ports from the Caddyfile
4. Provides quick actions via Homebrew services or direct caddy commands

## Tips

- The menu bar updates automatically when you interact with it
- Use âŒ˜R to manually refresh the status
- Domain URLs are automatically detected with proper protocol (http/https) based on port
